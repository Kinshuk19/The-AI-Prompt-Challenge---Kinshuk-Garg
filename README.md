I want to design a website by the name of "quickbites". the website should be interactive, should have various animations and effects and should be professional. the various sections in the website should be like: at the top there should be a header section which contains the name "QuickBites" on left side and the right side should have various buttons like home, menu, offers, contact, cart etc. these buttons should be completely functional and should redirect me to the respective page or section on the wesbite. below header there should be some moving images of various food items, cuisines etc and should have a slogan of "QuickBites" along with a order now button (this button should redirect me to the menu section where i can filter through various food items and add them to my cart). below this images section there should be a section of food browsing according to their categories like we usually see on zomato or swiggy. when i click on repsective categories i should be redirected to those respective food items from the menu. then comes the today's offer section. this section should include various interactive offers like 20% off, items below 199, flat 50% off etc etc. if there are multiple offers then there should be button to toggle through all the offers, then comes the menu section below this where i can see the food items which are most loved and reordered by the customers from the platform. along with filter and search option as well. at the end there should be a footer section where there should be various sections like contact, about, raise a complaint etc etc. all the images used should be properly visible and should be eye catching. the website should be interactive along with proper animations and everything. use proper colouring scheme for the website which should be very minimalist and relaxing and should attractive to the customers. include proper images for the food items.
